```

## Fixing Exploits

There are several key questions we generally need to ask while approaching the code:

```text
Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
Does it access a specific web application path or route?
Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability? Is there any HTTP method involved?
Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?
```
